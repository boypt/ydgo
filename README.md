# YouDao Console Version

Simple wrapper for Youdao online translate (Chinese <-> English) service [API](http://fanyi.youdao.com/openapi?path=data-mode), as an alternative to the StarDict Console Version(sdcv).

This is a GO portation from the original [ydcv in python](https://github.com/felixonmars/ydcv)

This project is a practise during the study of Go (newbie work in 100 lines). If you have any idea improving this project, pull request is welcomed.

## Environment:
 * Any OS that GO supports (windows, linux, freebsd, darwin ...)
